# Blueprint Bacaro Architecture
The "blueprint-bacaro-architecture" project was born as a CLI developed to generate projects using the MEAN stack as a reference, that is, MERN but without React's R. In fact, what you can do with this CLI is generate a ready-to-use monorepo project.

2. Compile the .env file with your preferences
3. Place a copy of the .env file in the dist folder
4. Make a npm i
